# Nova Task

Reimagined as Nova Task, this project brings a fresh approach to the classic todo list app, boasting seamless animations and an intuitive user interface. Users can organize tasks within projects, filter them by time periods (today, tomorrow, or view all), and effortlessly manage projects and tasks by adding, deleting, or editing them. The application leverages the Web Storage API for local browser data storage, ensuring a smooth user experience.
